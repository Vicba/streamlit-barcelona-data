## 👀 Overview
This is my personal blog. I started this to get out of my comfort zone and improve my writing skills. Besides that it's just fun.
There will be posts about my experiences, thoughts and ideas.

Hope you like it!

## 🚀 Quick start
Run the following commands to test it out!

1. Clone this project

`git clone https://github.com/Vicba/streamlit-barcelona-data.git` 

2. Run the script

`streamlit run app.py`



## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the files and directories you'll see in the project.

    .
    ├── data
    ├── .gitignore
    └── README.md


1.  **`/data`**: This directory will contain all of the data sets csv files that are related to the python file.

2.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
